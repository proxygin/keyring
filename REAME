==========

Store passwords in an encrypted file for you to grep through later. For the
classic "let me just copy-paste this password for the termital into this prompt"
use --easy-copy and --cloak-pass. This will only output the password and do it
white on white. You nosy co-workers won't event know there is a password right
in front of them! Muhaha
